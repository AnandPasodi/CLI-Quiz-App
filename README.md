# CLI-Quiz-App
### Description:
This is an amazing CLI Quiz application that I have build. It has a series of question and you are awarded 1 point for every right answer and final score displayed at the end of the game.
### Technologies Used:
  1. JavaScript (Node JS).
  2. Replit.
  3. readLineSync npm readlineSync.
#### Brief:
In this project, I have used an readlineSync module to read the input from the user, and then an object of questions and answers. To check the answers, I have used loop to keep moving to next questions. For score, I have set a global variable that gets incremented.
